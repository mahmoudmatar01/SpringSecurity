# Spring Security README

## Overview

Security is a crucial aspect of software application design, ensuring that only authorized users can access secured resources. When it comes to securing an application, two fundamental aspects to consider are **authentication** and **authorization**.

- **Authentication:** The process of verifying the user's identity, typically by requesting credentials.
  
- **Authorization:** The process of verifying whether a user is allowed to perform a specific activity.

**Spring Security** is a powerful and flexible security framework designed for securing Java-based web applications. While commonly used with Spring-based applications, it can also be employed to secure non-Spring-based web applications.

## Spring Boot Security

Spring Security can be applied at various layers of an application, including web URLs and service layer methods. By adding the Spring Security starter (`spring-boot-starter-security`) to a Spring Boot application, you can:

1. Enable **HTTP basic security**.
2. Register the authentication manager bean with an in-memory store and a single user.
3. Ignore paths for commonly used static resource locations (e.g., `/css/**`, `/js/**`, `/images/**`).
4. Enable common low-level features such as XSS, CSRF, caching, etc.

## Security Concepts

### Authentication

Authentication involves checking the user ID and password against credentials stored in the application or a database.

### Authorization

Authorization checks whether a user has the authorized role to perform a specific activity.

## Declarative Security

Spring Security supports declarative security, allowing you to define the application's security constraints in configuration:

- All Java config (`@Configuration`, no XML).
- Spring XML config.

This approach provides a clear separation of concerns between application code and security, making it easier to manage and maintain.

## Getting Started

To integrate Spring Security into your Spring Boot application:

1. Add the Spring Security starter to your project.

 ```xml
 <dependency>
     <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
     <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
 </dependency>
```

1. Customize security settings based on your application requirements.

2. Test and iterate, ensuring that authentication and authorization are working as expected.
